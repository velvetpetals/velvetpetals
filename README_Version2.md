# Velvet Petals — Static Website

This is a lightweight static site for "Velvet Petals India Pvt. Ltd." suitable for GitHub Pages or Netlify.

Contents:
- index.html — Main site
- styles.css — Styling
- script.js — Product rendering, modal, cart (localStorage)
- products.json — Example product data
- logo.svg — Simple SVG logo

How to use
1. Place all files in the same directory.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview.
3. Edit `products.json` to update product data and image URLs.
4. Replace placeholder images with your product photos (host them on your server or an image CDN).
5. Update contact email and company text in `index.html`.

Deploy
- GitHub Pages: Push to a repository and enable Pages in repository settings.
- Netlify / Vercel: Drag & drop the folder or connect your repo for automatic deploys.

Next improvements you might want
- Replace alerts and placeholders with a backend (orders API) and integrate a payment gateway (Razorpay / Stripe).
- Add per-product pages (seo-friendly URLs) and more product metadata (skus, stock).
- Implement server-side contact form handling or use an email API (SendGrid / Mailgun).
- Add analytics, SEO meta tags, and structured data for products.

If you want, I can:
- Customize colors, fonts, and a polished logo for your brand.
- Prepare a GitHub-ready commit tree and push to your repository (I can generate the files and give exact git commands; I won't push without your permission).
- Convert this into a small React app or a template for Shopify/WooCommerce.
